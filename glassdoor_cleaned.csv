Day to day optimizations, PAs always coming by to give you feedback can make it seem like all that matters is your numbers. Focus on your numbers and output, focus focus focus. Problem for me was that even though I could do great and kept a high quality, maintaining that speed and quality was really draining, especially at 10 hour shifts in an industrial environment with literally only your 2 (sometimes none) neighbors to talk to to pass the long day of repetitive tasks. That's another thing, the physical and mental aspect of the repetitious task is not just mentally draining, but despite their regular safety meetings, warnings, and signs plastered all over the place, there's so much pressure to increase performance consistently that lots of people are cutting corners just to keep from getting canned. I myself ended up with a repetitive motion injury in my hand due to pulling items out of cubbies and it's basically already covered by their policies so there's nothing to do but grin and bear it. My recommendation? Educate yourself on the safety policies, speak up loudly and frequently in group settings when you feel something isn't safe (to keep leadership accountable) and don't push yourself physically to meet your numbers. It's difficult when you've got bills to pay but not worth your long term mobility and health. Build your skills and find work with another company that respects your body more.",3.0,1.0,3.0

They lay for school and offer career programs although the tests to get into them are very difficult","Forced mandatory extra time. (My MET was 5 days of 11 1/2 hours and my regular shift is 3 days of 12 hours) you will get forced to cross trained and you will get labor shares to different departments wether you like that position or not. They have a very high expectations for making “rates” in your position. Managers and anyone in lead positions will micromanage and breathe down your neck. You are always getting watched and judged and everyone will shut down any minimal concern you have because nobody cares. They just care about saving their own behind. If you get hurt, well you better pray that you don’t because their AmCare will send you to their own doctor and they will lie and say you weren’t hurt at all so that they don’t have to pay for your injury or have you sue them. Some departments are very strict and WILL find reasons to write you up. You have to use some of your break time to get back to your station and sign in and scan something by the end of your break or you will get in trouble. You will use some of your break time just walking to the break area because it is SO far and so are the restrooms and don’t forget you need to use your break time to come back from break on time or you’ll get in trouble",3.0,1.0,3.0
